Examples:

It won't take *that* long to download this 650MB cd image over Mom's
33.6Kbps modem, will it? I can just let it run all night.

    % ucalc "650MB/33.6Kbps"
    1.834 day

What's the throughput for random 8KB reads, using a hard disk with
20MB/sec transfers and an average access latency of 15ms?

    % perl -MMath::Calc::Units=readable -le 'print foreach (readable("8KB / (8KB/(20MB/sec) + 15ms)"))'

    532.3 byte / millisec
    1.785 gigabyte / hour
    42.83 gigabyte / day
    519.8 kilobyte / sec
    30.46 megabyte / minute

Note: ucalc is a thin wrapper script that pretty much does what the
one-liner above does.

Installing:
