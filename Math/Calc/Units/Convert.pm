# things to canonical units. But this routine may be called with eg
# 120 minutes -> hours. So we convert both the current and target to
# canonical units, and divide the first by the second. (It'll be a
# pain when I need to add units that aren't just multiples of each
# other, but that's not what this tool is for anyway...)
