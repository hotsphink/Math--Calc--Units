You are hereby granted permission to use this software under the terms
of either the GPL or the Artistic License. I have the right to change
the licensing terms at any time, but if you hide a copy on a floppy in
the back of your underwear drawer, then you'll still be able to use it
under the terms above because that's just the way things work. (I own
the copyright, but I just gave you a license to use this version under
the GPL or the Artistic license, and I can't take it back without
breaking into your house and digging through your underwear drawer.)
You, however, cannot implement an animated paperclip extension and
pick a different license to give your modified copy away under,
because you don't own the copyright and the GPL doesn't allow that nya
nya. That is, until you remember that you can choose to use it under
the Artistic License, which does allow that sort of thing, at least
for the part you wrote. So go right ahead.
